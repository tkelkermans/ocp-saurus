# OCP: IPI Installation

OCP Installer Provisioned Installation (IPI) has been released in August 2022. It gives cusotmer a intutive and easy way to deploy OCP cluster on Nutanix AOS.

In this lab we will go through the steps of deploying OCP cluster using IPI.

:::info

Estimated time to complete this lab is 60 minutes.

:::

:::info

Although it might seem like a lot of work for IPI, the aim of the lab is to take you through the one-time process a customer would go through. Once pre-requisites are set, customers can deploy as many number of OCP clusters.

You could also explore automating these one time pre-requisites preparation tasks using automation frameworks like Nutanix **NCM**.

:::

:::note References

We have referred to the following documents for building this lab:
- [Nutanix Dev - IPI on Nutanix](https://www.nutanix.dev/2022/08/16/red-hat-openshift-ipi-on-nutanix-cloud-platform)
- [RedHat IPI Installation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/installing/installing_nutanix/installing-nutanix-installer-provisioned.html#installation-configure-proxy_installing-nutanix-installer-provisioned)
- [RedHat IPI SSL Requirements](https://opendocs.nutanix.com/openshift/install/ipi/)
:::

## Pre-requisites

The following pre-requisites are necessary:

- Access to RedHat Console to download the following    
  - Pull secret
  - IPI installation binaries
  - Openshift access tools (oc, kubectl)
  - Cloud Credential Operator (CCOCTL) utility  binaries
- An SSL certificate for Prism Central signed by a Certification Authority (we will also create certificates in this lab)
- Networking requirements
  - AHV IPAM Network (your HPOC already has this)
  - DNS server (Windows AutoAD VM is deployed for DNS capabilities)
  - Static IP addresses in your AHV IPAM network for OCP's api and apps endpoints 

## High Level Plan

1. Prepare pre-requiisites
   - AHV Networking and DNS
   - OCP tools 
2. Prepare and install SSL certificate for Prism Central
3. Creating OCP IPI installation manifest files  
4. Installing OCP cluster and first login

## Preparing Pre-requisites

We will be doing this lab 

### Preparing your HPOC cluster

:::caution

If you are working on a HPOC cluster, make sure there are enough resources available to deploy a new OCP cluster.

Remove existing OCP clusters that you dont require anymore.

For latest OCP resource requirements refer to OpenShift portal [here.](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.9/installing/installing_platform_agnostic/installing-platform-agnostic.html#installation-minimum-resource-requirements_installing-platform-agnostic)

:::

#### AHV Networking 

We will first find two IPs for OCP ``api`` and ``apps`` ingress endpoints in our network and add it to the **Primary** IPAM network blacklist. 


1. Find the CIDR range for your  **Primary** IPAM network either from [RX](https://rx.corp.nutanix.com/) or from your instrutor

   ```bash title="CIDR example for your Nutanix cluster"
   10.38.18.192/26
   ```

2. Logon to your UserXX-LinuxToolsVM using Mac Terminal or Windows Putty 

   - Username: root
   - Password: default 

3. Prepare the UserXX-LinuxToolsVM 
   
   ```bash
   yum update -y
   yum install -y nmap
   ```

3. Find two unused static IP addresses

   ```bash
   nmap -v -sn  <your CIDR>
   ```
   ```bash title="Sample command"
   nmap -v -sn 10.38.18.192/26

   ```
   ```bash {1,2} title="Sample output - choose the first two consecutive IPs"
   Nmap scan report for 10.38.18.219 [host down] 
   Nmap scan report for 10.38.18.220 [host down]
   Nmap scan report for 10.38.18.221
   Host is up (-0.098s latency).
   ```

2. Logon to any CVM in your cluster and execute the following to add chosen static IPs to the **Primary** IPAM network

   - Username: nutanix
   - Password: your cluster password 
   
   ```bash
   acli net.add_to_ip_blacklist Primary ip_list=10.38.18.219,10.38.18.220
   ```

### Add DNS Records

In this section we will add PC, API and APPS Ingress DNS records for lookup by OCP IPI installer 

1. Logon to the AutoAD windows VM 

   - Username: administrator
   - Password: default

2. We will add the following entries to DNS server using the two consecutive IPs you found in the previous section
   
   ```buttonless
   10.38.18.219   api.your_ocp_cluster_subdomain.ntnxlab.local
   10.38.18.220   *.apps.your_ocp_cluster_subdomain.ntnxlab.local
   10.38.18.201   pc.ntnxlab.local
   ```

2. Open PowerShell as Administrator and create the two A records

   ```PowerShell title="Add the API A record - use your own subdomain"
   Add-DnsServerResourceRecordA -Name api.<your_ocp_cluster_subdomain> -IPv4Address 10.38.18.219 -ZoneName ntnxlab.local -ZoneScope ntnxlab.local
   ```
   ```PowerShell title="Add the apps Ingress A record - use your own subdomain"
   Add-DnsServerResourceRecordA -Name *.apps.api.<your_ocp_cluster_subdomain> -IPv4Address 10.38.18.220 -ZoneName ntnxlab.local -ZoneScope ntnxlab.local 
   ```
   ```PowerShell title="Add the Prism Central A record"
   Add-DnsServerResourceRecordA -Name pc -IPv4Address <your PC IP> -ZoneName ntnxlab.local -ZoneScope ntnxlab.local 
   ```

   ```buttonless title="Sample commands with 'xyz' as a subdomain and your OCP cluster name"
   Add-DnsServerResourceRecordA -Name api.xyz -IPv4Address 10.38.18.219 -ZoneName ntnxlab.local -ZoneScope ntnxlab.local
   Add-DnsServerResourceRecordA -Name *.apps.xyz -IPv4Address 10.38.18.220 -ZoneName ntnxlab.local -ZoneScope ntnxlab.local 
   Add-DnsServerResourceRecordA -Name pc -IPv4Address 10.38.18.201 -ZoneName ntnxlab.local -ZoneScope ntnxlab.local
   ```

3. Test name resolution for added entries

   ```PowerShell {6,13,20}
   nslookup api.xyz.ntnxlab.local
   Server: dc.ntnxlab.local
   Address: 10.38.18.203

   Name: api.xyz.ntnxlab.local
   Address: 10.38.18.219 
   #
   nslookup myapp.apps.xyz.ntnxlab.local
   Server: dc.ntnxlab.local
   Address: 10.38.18.203

   Name: myapp.apps.xyz.ntnxlab.local
   Address: 10.38.18.220
   #
   nslookup pc.ntnxlab.local
   Server: dc.ntnxlab.local
   Address: 10.38.18.203

   Name: pc.ntnxlab.local
   Address: 10.38.3.201
   ```

### Downloading OCP Tools 

We will need to the OCP tools mentioned in the pre-requisites section to prepare our environment

:::info

You can get the URLs to download the tools and pull secret from RedHat Console: 

Openshift > Clusters > Create Clusters > Datacenter > [Nutanix AOS](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/nutanix/installer-provisioned)

:::


1. Logon to UserXX-LinuxToolsVM and download the binaries

   - Username: root
   - Password: default 

   ```bash
   mkdir xyz
   cd xyz
   curl -O https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/x86_64/clients/ocp/stable/openshift-install-linux.tar.gz
   curl -O https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/x86_64/clients/ocp/stable/openshift-client-linux.tar.gz 
   ```

2. Extract the binaries and copy them to ``/usr/local/bin`` for pathless access
   
   ```bash
   tar xvf openshift-install-linux.tar.gz
   tar xvf openshift-client-linux.tar.gz 
   # Add to path 
   cp kubectl /usr/local/bin
   cp oc /usr/local/bin
   cp openshift-install /usr/local/bin
   ```
2. Go to the [IPI Installer Web Console](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/nutanix/installer-provisioned) and click on **Copy pull secret** button

3. Now that the pull secret value is in your clipboard, paste the contents string to a pull secret file in the same directory

   ```bash
   echo "paste copied pull secret content here" > pull_secret.json
   ```
4. Make sure all the files are in the xyz directory 

   ```bash
   ls -l 
   ```
   ```bash {5} title="Directory listing"
   -rwxr-xr-x 2 root root 123877776 Aug 29 16:30 kubectl
   -rwxr-xr-x 2 root root 123877776 Aug 29 16:30 oc
   drwxr-x--- 2 root root      4096 Sep 22 06:56 openshift
   -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 481972224 Sep  1 16:07 openshift-install
   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root      2819 Sep 22 05:27 pull_secret.json
   ```

### Setting up Cloud Credential Operator Utility (CCOCTL)

Setting up of is necessary for Nutanix cluster credentials to be used with OCP cluster. 

Refer to [Cloud Credential Operator CCO](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/authentication/managing_cloud_provider_credentials/about-cloud-credential-operator.html) for more information. 

1. In the UserXX-LinuxToolsVM, download and setup ``ccoctl`` using the following commands

   ```bash
   RELEASE_IMAGE=$(openshift-install version | awk '/release image/ {print $3}')

   CCO_IMAGE=$(oc adm release info --image-for='cloud-credential-operator' $RELEASE_IMAGE)

   oc image extract $CCO_IMAGE --file="/usr/bin/ccoctl" -a pull_secret.json

   chmod u+x ccoctl && cp ccoctl /usr/local/bin/ 
   ```
2. Make sure the ccoctl file is present 

   ```bash
   ls -l ccoctl 
   -rwxr-x--x 1 root root  72158183 Aug 29 16:33 ccoctl
   ```
3. Create a Prism Central credentials file

   ```bash {7}
   cat << EOF > pc_credentials.yaml
   credentials:
   - type: basic_auth
     data:
       prismCentral:
         username: "admin"
         password: "PC-PASSWORD"
   EOF
   ```

4. Edit the ``pc_credentials.yaml`` file to include your password

   ```bash
   vi pc_credentials.yaml
   ```

4. Extract the CredentialsRequests objects for Nutanix Prism Central and store in a ``credreqs`` directory

   ```bash
   oc adm release extract --credentials-requests --cloud=nutanix --to=credreqs -a pull_secret.json $RELEASE_IMAGE
   ```

5. Use the ccoctl tool to process the CredentialsRequests objects and generate secret manifest files. These manifests file will be used during OCP cluster Certification

   ```bash
   ccoctl nutanix create-shared-secrets --credentials-requests-dir=credreqs --output-dir=. --credentials-source-filepath=pc_credentials.yaml
   ```
   ```buttonless title="Ouput"
   2022/09/29 23:53:36 Saved credentials configuration to: manifests/openshift-machine-api-nutanix-credentials-credentials.yaml
   ```

6. Check the ``manifests/openshift-machine-api-nutanix-credentials-credentials.yaml`` file to make sure the contents are good

   ```buttonless {8}
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
      name: nutanix-credentials
      namespace: openshift-machine-api
   type: Opaque
   data:
      credentials: W3sidHlwZSI6ImJhc2ljX2F1dGgiLCJkYXRhIjp7InByaXNtQ2VudHJhbCI6eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6ImFkbWluIiwicGFzc3dvcmQiOiJ0ZWNoWDIwMjAhIn0sInByaXNtRWxlbWVudHMiOm51bGx9fV0=
   ```

### Creating and Installing SSL Certificate on Prism Central

In this section we will do the following:

- Create a Root CA on your UserXX-LinuxToolsVM
- Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for Prism Central 
- Sign the CSR using Root CA's private key

All this will be done on the UserXX-LinuxToolsVM.

1. In the UserXX-LinuxToolsVM, Create a the Root CA certificates

   ```bash
   openssl genrsa -out rootCA.key 2048
   openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key rootCA.key -sha256 -days 1024 -out rootCA.crt
   ```
   ```bash title="Execution example - make sure to retype the input values as shown here"
   openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key rootCA.key -sha256 -days 1024 -out rootCA.crt
   ##
   You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
   into your certificate request.
   What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
   There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
   For some fields there will be a default value,
   If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
   -----
   Country Name (2 letter code) [XX]:JP
   State or Province Name (full name) []:Chiba
   Locality Name (eg, city) [Default City]:Kashiwa
   Organization Name (eg, company) [Default Company Ltd]:nutanix
   Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:rootca
   Common Name (eg, your name or your server's hostname) []:rootca.ntnxlab.local
   Email Address []:first.last@nutanix.com
   ```
   
2. Create an answer file for Prism Central's certificate parameters. Feel free to change your country, state and locality names.

   ```bash
   cat << EOF > pc.conf
   [ req ]
   default_bits       = 2048
   distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
   req_extensions     = req_ext
   [ req_distinguished_name ]
   countryName = JP
   stateOrProvinceName = Chiba
   localityName = Kashiwa
   organizationName = pc
   commonName = ntnxlab.local
   [ req_ext ]
   subjectAltName = @alt_names
   [alt_names]
   DNS.1   = pc.ntnxlab.local
   DNS.2   = prism.ntnxlab.local
   EOF
   ```
3. Create the private key and CSR for Prism Central
  
   ```bash
   openssl genrsa -out pc.key 2048
   openssl req -new -sha256  -key pc.key -config ./pc.conf -out pc.csr
   ```
   ```bash title="Execution example - make sure to retype the input values as shown here"
   openssl req -new -sha256  -key pc.key -config ./pc.conf -out pc.csr
   ##
   You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
   into your certificate request.
   What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
   There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
   For some fields there will be a default value,
   If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
   -----
   JP []:JP
   Chiba []:Chiba
   Kashiwa []:Kashiwa
   pc []:pc
   ntnxlab.local []:ntnxlab.local
   ```

4. Get your Prism Central's  DNS details from the CSR you created

   ```bash
   openssl req -noout -text -in pc.csr | grep DNS
   ```
   ```bash title="Output"
   DNS:pc.ntnxlab.local, DNS:prism.ntnxlab.local
   ```

5. Create a file called pctext to store the DNS/SAN names

   ```bash
   echo "subjectAltName = DNS:pc.ntnxlab.local, DNS:prism.ntnxlab.local" >> pctext
   ```
6. Sign the CSR using rootCA's private key and produce a certificate for Prism Central

   ```bash
   openssl x509 -req -in pc.csr -CA rootCA.crt -CAkey rootCA.key -CAcreateserial -out pc.crt -days 1024 -sha256 -extfile pctext
   ```

7. List the contents of the directory to make sure pc.crt, pc.key and rootCA.crt files are present

   ```bash
   ls -l *.crt *.key | awk '{print $9}'
   ```
   ```bash title="Output"
   pc.crt               ## Prism Central's public certificate signed by Root CA
   pc.key               ## Prism Central's private key
   rootCA.crt           ## Root CA's public certificate
   rootCA.key           ## Root CA's private key
   ```
   
8. ``cat`` out the contents of ``rootCA.crt``, ``pc.key`` and ``pc.crt`` and copy them to the UserXX-WindowsToolsPC in separate files

   ```buttonless
   cat rootCA.crt
   cat pc.key
   cat pc.crt
   ```

9. In WindowsToolsPC, use Notepad to create three new files with the same names

7. Copy the ouput of previous cat command of ``rootCA.crt``, ``pc.key`` and ``pc.crt`` files into to your UserXX-WindowsToolsPC VM in any directory

   ![](images/certs-on-wintools.png)

8. Logon to Prism Central Web GUI on the WindowsToolsPC

9. Go to **Settings > SSL Certificate**

10. Click on **Replace Certificate** 

11. Select **Import Key and Certificate**

12. Click **Next**

13. Choose the following:
    
    - Private Key Type - RSA 2048 bit 
    - Private Key - ``pc.key``
    - Public Certificate - ``pc.crt``
    - CA Certificate/Chain - ``rootCA.crt``

13. Click on **Import Files**

    ![](images/import-certs.png)

    Prism Central GUI will accept the certificate and restart for the changes to take effect. 

    You have now successfully installed SSL certificate on Prism Central.

    :::caution

    Do not proceed to the next steps until Prism Central Certificate is installed without errors. 

    Contact your lab instructors if you need help with troubleshooting SSL certificate issues.

    :::

## Creating IPI Installation Config File 

In this section we will create our installation configuration files which will be then used in the next section to deploy an OCP cluster.

### Preparing UserXX-LinuxToolsVM 

1. Logon to your UserXX-LinuxToolsVM 

2. Copy the Root CA's public certificate to the local certiface repository

   ```bash
   cd xyz
   cp rootCA.crt /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
   ```
3. Update the local CA trust repository with the new one your created

   ```bash
   update-ca-trust
   ```
   Now your UserXX-LinuxToolsVM will be able to trust SSL connections to Prism Central and will ``openshift-install`` binary

4. Create a local ssh key which we will then use to access all the OCP cluster nodes/vms
   
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen
   ```
   ```buttonless title="Execution example - accept default values"
   Generating public/private rsa key pair.
   Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa): 
   /root/.ssh/id_rsa already exists.
   Overwrite (y/n)? y
   Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):  
   Enter same passphrase again: 
   Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
   Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
   The key fingerprint is:
   SHA256:1gjz5zWw+aS7hiEje/pDGY2N5Y5anh6JEQYVf9GRmgs root@centos
   The key's randomart image is:
   +---[RSA 2048]----+
   |  ..o.  ...o     |
   |   . .  ..o      |
   |    o +B.o.      |
   |   . .E=*o +     |
   |    .  *S.= +    |
   |    .oBo+o = .   |
   |    .Bo+ oo .    |
   |    o =.. ..     |
   |    .=o. .o.     |
   +----[SHA256]-----+
   ```
### Creating the Installation Manifests (files)

1. In your UserXX-LinuxToolsVM 

2. Change to you working directory that we created before

   ```bash
   cd /root/xyz
   ```
3. Run the create install config command

   :::tip 
   Copy the pull_secret value from Red Hat Console or the ``pull_secret.json`` file into your clipboard as you will need to input in the interactive command execution
   :::

   ```bash
   openshift-install create install-config 
   ```
   ```buttonless title="Execution example "
   # openshift-install create install-config 
   ? SSH Public Key /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ? Platform nutanix
   ? Prism Central pc.ntnxlab.local 
   ? Port 9440
   ? Username admin
   ? Password [? for help] **********                 # << Your Prism Central password entered as plain text
   INFO Connecting to Prism Central pc.ntnxlab.local 
   ? Prism Element PHX-SPOC018-4                      # << Choose your Prism Element cluster
   INFO Defaulting to only available network: Primary 
   ? Virtual IP Address for API 10.38.18.219          # << Type the API IP 
   ? Virtual IP Address for Ingress 10.38.18.220      # << Type the Ingress IP
   ? Base Domain ntnxlab.local                        # << Type the name of your base domain 
   ? Cluster Name xyz                                 # << Type the name of your sub domain or OCP cluster's name
   ? Pull Secret [? for help] ************************************************
   INFO Install-Config created in: .
   ```

4. Now we have to prepare the install-config.yaml file by adding the following details:

   - Your self hosted Root CA's certificate
   - Number of replcas for worker nodes (3 workers to 2 worker)
   - Machine network details (your HPOC's subnet)
   

5. Add the details:

   ```bash
   vi install-config.yaml
   ```
   ```yml {4-15,21,37} title="Sample install-config.yaml file. You can also reduce the number of workers to 2"
   apiVersion: v1
   baseDomain: ntnxlab.local

7. Check the contents of ``manifests`` and ``openshift`` directories to make sure all the files are present

   ```bash
   ls -l openshift manifests
   ```
8. We have one last requirement to let IPI installer know that we will be using a self generated CA bundle, edit the ``manifests/cluster-proxy-01-config.yaml`` file to match the following:

   ```yml {8}
   apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
   kind: Proxy
   metadata:
     creationTimestamp: null
     name: cluster
   spec:
     trustedCA:
       name: "user-ca-bundle" 
   ```
## Deploying OCP Cluster  

This will be simplest part of all, provided you have done everything correctly to this point. 

1. Start the installation of OCP cluster by executing the following

   ```bash 
   openshift-install create cluster 
   ```
   :::tip 
   if you would like to see debug details and be able to capture logs, and also have access to the console, execute the following command:

   ```bash 
   openshift-install create cluster --log-level=debug | tee create-cluster.log &
   ```
   :::

2. A typical installation flow would look like this

   ```buttonless {16,18}
   # openshift-install create cluster
   INFO Consuming Master Machines from target directory 
   INFO Consuming OpenShift Install (Manifests) from target directory 
   INFO Consuming Common Manifests from target directory

   INFO To access the cluster as the system:admin user when using 'oc', run 
   INFO     export KUBECONFIG=/root/xyz/auth/kubeconfig 
   INFO Access the OpenShift web-console here: https://console-openshift-console.apps.xyz.ntnxlab.local 
   INFO Login to the console with user: "kubeadmin", and password: "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx" 
   INFO Time elapsed: 27m0s
   ```
3. Once the installation is done we can access OCP cluster using the following ways:

   ```bash title="OC or kubectl command line"
   export KUBECONFIG=/root/xyz/auth/kubeconfig
   ```
   ```bash
   oc get nodes
   ##
   NAME                     STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION
   xyz-6zlwh-master-0       Ready    master   3d14h   v1.24.0+b62823b

   xyz-6zlwh-worker-njv66   Ready    worker   3d14h   v1.24.0+b62823b
   ```
   Through the OCP GUI using kubeadmin credentials

   From your UserXX-WindowsToolsPC, open Chrome

   Open the following URL
   
   ```url
